    <H1>Hello People!!!</h1>
    <p>Tinkering...that is what I love to do. I am 12 years old. I go around breaking things whichever seems interesting to me. I look how it is inside and how it works. I started doing this(breaking things)after I started going to Mango Education. Here I learnt stuff I never knew. I also did experiments based on the topic i learnt. My hobbies are playing guitar, chess and stargazing.</p>
